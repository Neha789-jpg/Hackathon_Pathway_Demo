This is a demo pipeline to check if a backstory contradicts story excerpts.
The pipeline is hackathon-ready and uses mocked GPT predictions to simulate AI responses.
## Files
- main.py        : Demo script with mocked GPT predictions
- novel_1.txt    : Sample novel input
- backstory_1.txt: Sample backstory input
- results.csv    : Output prediction file (generated by script)
## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Open a terminal in this folder
3. Run the script:
    python main.py
4. The script will generate `results.csv` with predictions
## Notes
- GPT predictions are mocked for demo purposes due to API quota limits
- The pipeline works with real GPT models if API access is available
- This demo is fully runnable and shows the complete workflow
